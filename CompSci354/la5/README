I used the VMWare and C# Express to port this program.  The only major snag that I ran into while trying to 
learn this was figuring out how to get the VM up and running on the lab computers.  For some reason, it was
just not working for me and I kept somehow opening the wrong version of Windows.  But once I got that figured
out, I was really off and running.

For the differences between the programs, there were a couple but they are much more similar than scheme and prolog are to java.  One thing I was really interested in was the if statements in the method Button_Click.  It really 
interesting to me that you can use that kind of if statement and just set it equal to a variable (you might be able
to do this in other languages but I still thought it was really different looking).  I also thought it was 
interesting how to return a 0 in C#, you have to put it in quotations instead of just saying return 0;.  Besides
those differences and learning how to get a VM working on Onyx, I found this language fairly easy and comforting than other languages that we have learned in this class.
