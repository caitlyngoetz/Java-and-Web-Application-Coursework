There were three files with bugs in them:
	*DebuggerTest2.java
	*FindRoute.java
	*Car.java
	
DebuggerTest2.java
The bug in this one was that the index was out of range.  So all I did to the fleet.length()
was subtract one from it.  Thus putting the object back in range and making it so that 
it did not try and add a value to a nonexisting array object.

FindRout.java
The bug in this class was that the while loop had a semicolon after it as well as a curly
bracket.  So all I did was take out the semicolon.  This ended the  endless loop.

Car.java
There was actually two things that I had to fix in this one.  They are both the same thing
mostly.  When the car was making a direction change its current position variable was being
modified the wrong way.  So all I had to do was to make the +'s into -'s and visa versa for 
the ones that were wrong.
