OVERVIEW:

	This program builds a Mine Walker game that allows the user to find the safest path through the mines by clicking
	and interacting with the program.
	
INCLUDED FILES:
	* MineWalker.java  - this file builds the container and JFrame for the program to run on.
	* MineWalkerPanel.java   - This program builds the rest of the GUI components and defines the game play.
	* RandomWalk.java    -  This program finds a safe path from the start to the finish to make sure the game is playable.
	* README   - This is this file
	
BUILDING AND RUNNING
	All project files should be in the same directory.
	From the directory containing the .java source code, compile the program:
		$ javac MineWalkerPanel.java
	Run the program from the directory containing MineWalkerPanel.class:
		$ java MineWalkerPanel
		
	The program will then bring up the game screen.
	
PROJECT DESIGN NOTES:
	The MineWalker builds the JFrame and extends the container so that all the panels can
	be added into the Frame.  The MineWalkerPanel builds the gridPanel, sidePanel, and 
	bottomPanel.  It uses the game play criteria to check for valid moves and to display
	the color off of the color key that depicts the amount of mines.  It contains an 
	actionListener that listens for the clicking of the mouse or the sliding of the gridSlider.
	Most of the came play is written into the actionListener and the game buttons are separated
	into other methods that control what happens when the buttons are clicked for game play.
	So the hideMines method hides the mines when the "Hide Mine" button is clicked.  So all
	of the methods are named to do what they do.  For scoring, the game starts out with 500
	points.  Every time the person clicks/moves the score goes down 1 point.  If the player
	clicks the show mines button the score goes down 50 points.  And it goes downs by 250 points
	if the play hits the show path button.  When the player gets to the finish line (point 0,0)
	a pop-up box comes up and lets the user know that he/she won.  
	
TESTING
	I tested the program by dividing the program into smaller sections that were more manageable,
	and then I worked on the individual problems one at a time making sure they work along
	the way.  The program will not allow the user to click and make invalid moves or to alter
	the gridSize during the game.  As far as I know, there are not any issues or bugs remaining 
	in my program.
	
DISCUSSION:
	This program was very intensive.  There were a lot of little things going on that we 
	needed to make sure that they were working all together.  It was somewhat a technical
	project so I had problems with some of the technicalities.  I had the hardest time getting 
	color key for the buttons to work and stay there for the mines when the "Hide Mines" button
	was pushed.  Mostly this was just a hard program to think about if I don't break it down
	into smaller pieces and work on those pieces one by one.  But that is very time consuming.

EXTRA CREDIT:
	I did not attempt any extra credit for this project.  Thank you for the opportunity though!
