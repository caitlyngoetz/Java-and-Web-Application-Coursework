I had a problem getting it to say something different than "Hello World." Then I figured out you need to save it in Eclipse
in order to get it to compile in the Konsole.
Changing things in the program:
Changing the header name: it gave me the "public type hello must be defined in its own file."  I think this means that the
name of the project and the name of the new class has to match that way the class knows what project it belongs to.
Remove a semicolon: It tells me that I need to insert a ";" to complete the BlockStatement.  The semicolon tells the program
that that is the end of the line so without it, I guess the computer gets lost.
Remove a curly bracket: its says that the bracket is used to complete the Class Body, meaning that the brackets let the 
computer know when the class is done.
Removing a quote: It lets me know that the "string literal is not properly closed" So the quotations let the computer know 
what string to print and where it begins and ends
Changing main to Main: It didn't give me a error message but it did highlight the Main and I think that it wanted me to 
enter a string.
Taking out a ) at the end of the string line: It gave me an error message saying that I needed the final ) to complete the 
Expression.  Again I think this is needed to let the computer know when you are done with the message and what it should 
print.
Removed "void": The error message said that the "void" is the return type for the method.  So the void tells the program 
what it should return.

Making my own class (Quote.java)
A problem I kept running into was forgetting to put the semicolon at the end of the lines.  I didn't really run into any 
other problems in Eclipse.  I have a little bit of prior experience with it so I know the basics.  I also did not have any 
problems compiling and running it in the Konsole.
