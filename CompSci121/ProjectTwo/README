OVERVIEW:
	This program take input in the form of a title of a song, the artist, the 
	playtime (formatted like "##:##") and the file name.  It takes the input
	and compares the playtime to figure out the average playtime and it 
	figures out which one is closest to 4 minutes.  It then outputs a table
	that has the data in order from smallest playtime to fastest playtime.
	
	INCLUDED FILES:
		1. PlayList.java - This is where the main code is written
		2. Song.java - this keeps the songs with their respected data
		3. input.txt - this is a list of sample songs for easy entry into
		the program.
		4. README - this is this document
		
	BUILDING AND RUNNING:
		All project files should be in the same directory.
		
		From the directory containing the .java source code, compile the program:
		$ javac PlayList.java
		
		Run the program from the directory containing the PlayList.class and use
		the input.txt file for input:
		$ java PlayList < input.txt
		
		The program will then run itself and the output will appear on the screen.
