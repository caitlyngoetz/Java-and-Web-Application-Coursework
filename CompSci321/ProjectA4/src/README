OVERVIEW:

This program takes in a GeneBank file and converts it to a BTree, where each
object is a DNA sequence of a specified length. It parses through the file
and looks at all of the DNA subsequences. To save memory, the program takes 
the four possible bases and converts each of them into a 2 bit binary number.
The binary representation of the subsequences will result in a 64-bit integer
value that the program uses as a key value. The program also uses a cache to
improve the performance of the BTree. 

INCLUDED FILES:

BTree.java - Represents a BTree
BTreeNode.java - Represents a single node in the BTree
GeneBankCreateBTree.java - Creates a BTree out of a file from a GeneBank
GeneBankSearch.java - Searches a BTree file for DNA sequences
TreeObject.java - Stores a DNA subsequence in the BTree
BTreeIO.java - Represents a BTreeIO
FileParser.java - Parses through the files
Cache.java - Represents a cache
README - This file

BUILDING AND RUNNING:

All of the files should be located in one single directory.
From the directory containing the .java source code, compile the program:
	$ javac GeneBankCreateBTree.java 
	$ javac GeneBankSearch.java
	
Run the programs from the directory:
	$ java GeneBankeCreateBTree <degree> <gbk file> <sequence length> [<debug level>]
	$ java GeneBankSearch <btree file> <query file> [<debug level>]

PROGRAM DESIGN:

The main concept of this program is to work with BTrees in the field of bioinformatics.
This program has multiple classes that help it compile and run correctly. The class
BTree represents a BTree data structure that holds all of the DNA substring information. 
There is also a BTreeNode class that is similar, but only looks at a specific node of
the BTree structure. This class holds only a few methods though, because most of the 
others are located in the main BTree method. The GeneBankCreateBTree class is technically
the most important of the classes because it actually creates a BTree out of the info
from a Gene Bank file. 

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING DISCUSSION:

This program was insane. It was really cool to be able to implement so many of the things
that we learned this semester, but I felt like some of this project was a little bit out
of the scope of what we knew. We tried really hard to make everything work, but the errors
were so abundant that debugging was a real pain. Some of the errors were hard to understand
unfortunately so it took us quite awhile to fix those leaving us with little time to fully
fix the program. At this time, it doesn't fully work unfortunately. We really wish that 
we had more time at the beginning of the month to work on it, but we just had so much going
on in other classes that we were unable to have any focused time on it before this last week.
So, as of right now the program is not working and we feel way over our head with the scope of
this project.  There was just too much to do and there are so many exceptions to handle and maybe 
a little bit more direction on it then was given (although this project did have more instructions
than the previous projects, so yay there!)
