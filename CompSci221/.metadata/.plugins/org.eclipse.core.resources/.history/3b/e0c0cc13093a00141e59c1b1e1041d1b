This part was fairly easy once I figured out how to get the pivot value to come up.  Instead
of stepping over the value, I was stepping into it and the variable window wasn't displaying
the value of the variable pivotIndex but it was displaying the value of pivot.  But since it 
is easy to calculate the value of pivot, I didn't need to use that to come up with the values.
