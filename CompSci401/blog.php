			Hello everyone!!  So this page is where I am going to post blogs about things I see or do that has anything to my photography.  I am quite excited about being able to share my adventures with you!

	So currently, school has me swamped!  I know right, how rude!!  I haven't really been able to get out and go exploring with my camera since school started but hopefully that will change soon!  So until then I just want to let you know that I haven't given up on getting photos for this webpage!  However, until then you can look at this picture of my sister, Caitlyn, falling on her face.  I let you ponder how we managed to take this picture without fracturing ribs!!
